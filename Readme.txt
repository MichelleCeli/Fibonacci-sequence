Fibonacci Sequence

In the given task, I thought about how to visualize the Fibonacci Sequence without numbers. 
I implemented this with blocks scaled with the individual Fibonacci numbers. 
These fall in the pattern of the Fibonacci Spiral. 

Since the program is still very small, I put most of the code in the BlockManager-Script. Of course, 
if the program gets additional functions, it makes sense to outsource code and use the Block-Script as well.

Considerations for further functions would be, for example, to write the camera movement fluidly with FixedUpdate() 
and to include a return function with which the user can go back a number. 
One could also display all numbers, not just the current number, or draw the Fibonacci spiral as a graph. 

But here I kept the functionality low due to the given time.


Instructions:

- Click on "next" to see the next Fibonacci number
- Click on "reset" to delete the Fibonacci Sequence and to start it again
- Click on "exit" to quit the application


Design Choices:

Because the fibonacci series often occurs in nature, the user is outside in a meadow. I personally think it is curious, that the 
Fibonacci Sequence is that often represented in nature, so that I chose a calm, natural but thrilling background-sound.
I thought the Brick Blocks Design of the cubes harmonize with the nature setting. 

The Design of the buttons is adjusted to the colours of the brick blocks. The rounding of the buttons and the Font should have a
harmonious and calm effect on the user.
