Fibonacci Sequence

In the given task, I thought about how to visualize the Fibonacci Sequence without numbers. 
I implemented this with blocks scaled with the individual Fibonacci numbers. 
These fall in the pattern of the Fibonacci Spiral. 

Since the program is still very small, I put most of the code in the BlockManager-Script. Of course, 
if the program gets additional functions, it makes sense to outsource code and use the Block-Script as well.

Considerations for further functions would be, for example, to write the camera movement fluidly with FixedUpdate() 
and to include a return function with which the user can go back a number. 
One could also display all numbers, not just the current number, or draw the Fibonacci spiral as a graph. 

But here I kept the functionality low due to the given time.
